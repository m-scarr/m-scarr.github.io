                <strong>I am a Full Stack Developer living in Minneapolis.</strong>
                <br>
                <br> Growing up, my love of videogames compelled me to create my own. This love drove me to study and master
                an object-oriented language used for designing games (GML) by the age of 16. Since then, and throughout my
                journey, I have developed a passion for software design and the creative problem-solving it requires. I picked
                up HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My objective is to elevate my self-taught hobby into a full-time professional
                career.
                <br>
                <br> In May of 2018, I earned a certificate from the University of Minnesota's Coding Bootcamp. I excelled with
                ease and found a new appreciation for web development.
                <br>
                <br> My days are filled with learning new frameworks and implementations on the front and back end. I look forward
                to working with a professional development team!

                <div id="hardware">
                    I also started fiddling with, breaking, and fixing computers at a young age. I've always been extremely competent at repairing
                    OS problems, but was curious about hardware repair as well. When I turned 23, I got a job at a local
                    video game store as a repair technician. I was trained by an older technician and learned a variety of
                    high-level repairs. I learned how to micro-solder, as well as operate a processor reflow machine. I also
                    learned how to replace phone screens and many other unique and difficult repairs. After about 3 years
                    of working there, eventually as lead technician, I took a job working retail as the store could not afford
                    to pay me a living wage.
